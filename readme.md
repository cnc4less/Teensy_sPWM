Teensy Software PWM Library
===========================

This is a library for using software emulated pulse-width modulation on the Teensy and Arduino-like devices. Primary design goals are high frequency PWM (1KHz+) capability, and ease of use.

This software should be considered Alpha-quality, as it is currently in development and has not been thoroughly tested.
